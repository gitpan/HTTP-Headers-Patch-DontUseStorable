NAME
    HTTP::Headers::Patch::DontUseStorable - Do not use Storable

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Headers::Patch::DontUseStorable;

DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::Headers (6.05 as of this writing) tries to load Storable (2.39 as
    of this writing) and use its dclone() method. Since Storable still does
    not support serializing Regexp objects, HTTP::Headers/HTTP::Message
    croaks when fed data with Regexp objects.

    This patch avoids using Storable and clone using the alternative method.
