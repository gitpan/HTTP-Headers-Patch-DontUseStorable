NAME
    HTTP::Headers::Patch::DontUseStorable - Do not use Storable

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Headers::Patch::DontUseStorable;

DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::Headers (6.05 as of this writing) tries to load Storable (2.39 as
    of this writing) and use its dclone() method. Since Storable still does
    not support serializing Regexp objects, HTTP::Headers/HTTP::Message
    croaks when fed data with Regexp objects.

    This patch avoids using Storable and clone using the alternative method.

FAQ
  Is this a bug with HTTP::Headers? Why don't you submit a bug to HTTP-Message?
    I tend not to think this is a bug with HTTP::Headers; after all,
    Storable's dclone() is a pretty standard way to clone data in Perl. This
    patch is more of a workaround for current Storable's deficiencies.

  Shouldn't you add STORABLE_{freeze,thaw} methods to Regexp instead?
    Yes, that's also one possible solution, albeit with slightly more work.
    There's an old distribution, Regexp::Copy (last release is 0.06 in 2003,
    at the time of this writing) which does this, but last time I tried it
    no longer works.
